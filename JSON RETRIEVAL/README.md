# Getting JSON DATA FROM HTTP REQUESTS
In this app what i did was to make different cards to each of the data that we recieve from a dummy json data located at some DB.
<br>
From there things were really simple as you just have to encode the data to usable format
<br>
i am attaching a screenshot of the app.
